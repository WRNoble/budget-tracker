#Budget-Tracker:

Budget-Tracker is a React application which allows the users to insert both income and expense and tracks them but updating the total money the user has in their possession. In addition the application lists both income and expenses and allows the user to delete instances where an entry may have been made in error. The total will update to reflect any updates made to this section. The backend is built out with Express and MongoDB with Mongoose. This stores the data put into the application in the backend so that information is not lost upon refreshing the page.

##Installation:

The user who wishes to use this app will need to run this app locally will need to run "npm install" from within the budget-tracker folder to get the dependencies to download. The user should first have node installed on their local device. Both the frontend and backend are set up to run at the same time on your local host. You need to simply run the command "npm run dev" in your terminal if you wish to use your local host.

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

##Technologies Used:

The frontend is built entirely with React.js while the backend is built with Express.js while using MongoDB and Mongoose. The data itself is stored with Mongo Atlas.
