# Budget Tracker

This is a simple budget tracker. The program is designed to accept numerical input, both negative and positive, track it, and add or subtract it based upon the content of the total entries.

## Getting Started

A user only needs access to github pages as well as an Internet connection in order to load the program. If you wish to interact with the code itself you can clone this repository from github and run npm install to acquire the dependencies.

## Instructions

The program allows users to modify its contents by adding both deposits and withdraws. The user needs to provide a name for the transaction and place a numerical value in the amount field. If the amount is negative then the use places a "-" before the number. Clicking the button "Add Transaction." The new transaction will appear above and the new data will be reflected in the income and/or expenses tracker at the top. If a transaction is made in error, you may delete it by hovering over the entry under "Past Transactions" and clicking the "x" that appears on the left side of the desired entry.
